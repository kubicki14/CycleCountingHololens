# Cycle Counting Hololens PoC

### I've created an application/demo that displays the inventory of the keurig cups we have in-house, and allows you to update the count of keurig cups for each variety utilizing voice recognition and the Microsoft Hololens. Using augmented reality, a technical worker or warehouse manager could multi-task and solve their Cycle Counting problem by using the Hololens to manage theire inventory in real time.

## See demo video and speak with Lane (kubicki14) or Rob for more information.
